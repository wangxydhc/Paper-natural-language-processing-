create new task typically start date end date tasks activities one persons resources expected complete specified time frame
add remove resources tasks dependencies dependencies tasks resources indicate resources supposed complete task task could worked multiple persons person could work multiple tasks dependencies may also annotated capture many hours person supposed work task daily basis
change task begin end times manually user changes change start end date either editing properties dragging and dropping bar gui
change task begin end times automatically dependency changes start end date changed automatically links among tasks changed
change task begin end times automatically dependency changes start end date changed automatically one subtasks changes
prevent circular dependencies links among tasks may circular task cannot depend task task already depends task
show critical path critical path indicates tasks cause project delays delayed
add remove holidays vacation days holidays vacation days properties persons resources changing information also changes availability person certain days
show resource utilization underused overused person tasks may assigned persons indicated person receives tasks handle e person hours per task tasks exceeds allowed hours day person available due holidays vacation days also indicated person under utilized working less hours day
delete tasks delete existing task associated information links tasks knowledge resources supposed work
maintain task properties edit update task properties including start end date name progress complete
add remove tasks subtasks task made subtask another example task subtask task
handle milestones milestone special task whereas task typically timeframe specified the time needed complete task milestone typically event example release date software event rather timeframe
create resources person ganttproject supports persons resources persons names holidays vacation days persons assigned work tasks
delete resources person delete person associated information dependencies tasks person supposed work
maintain resource properties resource range properties including name holidays
add remove task links tasks linked one another indicate sequence performed example link task task task started task completed start date task must thus end date task

gui class human resource load distribution uses objects load distribution class capture hours person supposed work
load distribution class provides functions calculate distribution based tasks human resources functions uses task manager
gui needs change length task
using gui user change length task dragging and dropping bar gui
using gui user change length task via date picker control
dependency class contains dependant task dependee task provides functions get dependant task dependee task dependency class also contains constraint show constraint dependency
class used represent constraint start date dependee task earlier end date dependent task

gui class task property provides interface functions add remove dependencies using object dependency collection
gui class graphic area provides function draw dependency function uses object task manager add dependencies
ask manager class uses object dependency collection class manage dependencies
object recalculating task schedule algorithm class used change start end date based dependency changes algorithm class provides functions fulfill constraints modify start end date tasks
application needs keep track task begin end times
application needs keep track subtasks task
every time start end time subtask changes start end time parent task need change accordingly
every time start end time task changes start end time one subtasks need change well
gui class graphic area provides function draw dependency function uses object task manager add dependencies
ask manager class uses object dependency collection class manage dependencies
class dependency collection provides function check new dependency cause loop time object dependency class created function returns exception loop
gui needs display critical path make changes affecting critical path updated
evaluate critical path project
human resource class contains variable holidays class provides functions change get holidays multiple holidays
class represent holiday holiday class provides functions set begin date end date holiday check date holiday get duration holiday
human resource class provides function change availability person based holidays
gui needs assign task persons
gui needs assign persons tasks

delete task calendar ganttproject class call delete method supplied taskid paramenter adjustment allocated resources links tasks takes place interfacing following classes defaultmutabletreenode gantttreetablenode tasknode adjusttaskboundsalgorithm
deleting task ganttproject class calls gantttreetablenode defaultmutabletreenode classes identify parent task deleted
deleting task ganttproject class calls adjusttaskboundsalgorithm passes parent deleted task parameter adjusttaskboundsalgorithm takes care handling releasing resources associated deleted task
gui change task name
gui change start end date task
gui set progress task
start end date task changed start end dates subtasks need change accordingly
add tasks subtasks method indent selected task nodes gui change subtasks used manager task hierarchy provides functions update relationship tasks
manager task hierarchy provides method move task node specific position
remove tasks subtasks gantttree2 class calls method dedent selected task nodes gui subtasks original parents tasks object class used remove relationship selected tasks original parents add relationship selected tasks new parents
remove tasks subtasks method dedent selected task nodes gui subtasks original parents tasks used task tree model provides methods remove relationship selected tasks original parents add relationship selected tasks new parents
milestone task duration time point occurrence
user create milestones
user interface specify whether specific task milestone
milestone displayed visually differently regular tasks
