edu ncsu csc itrust exception dbexception
please note that is not the best mitigation denial of service attacks the better way would be to
keep track of password failure attempts per user account not with easily spoofable ip addresses the
reason feature is implemented with ip addresses is limitation in tomcat authentication actually
it technically jsp fault not specifying form of account lockout br
br
all authentication in application is done by the container tomcat which doesn support account
lockout so our options would be to implement our own authentication yuck or to extend the
jdbcrealm in the tomcat source code and add the logic ve looked into and it actually pretty
easy the only reason it not implemented here is that the code would be buried in jar in your tomcat
installation not very educational those who want to learn about authentication in webapps feel free
to change extending would be perfectly acceptable

bean purpose is to store data period little or no functionality is to be added to bean
with the exception of minor formatting such as concatenating phone numbers together
bean must only have getters and setters eclipse hint use source generate getters and setters
to create these easily
